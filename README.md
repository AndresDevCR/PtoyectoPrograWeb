Main idea:

It is to implement through the development of a web application a page for a vehicle company,
in which the system must create, read, update and delete the vehicles for sale, the page would be an e-commerce type,
will have the information of the company, the contacts and location of such company, the main strength of the company is the sale of and purchase of vehicles,
then the page has to be programmed so that it can be updated by a person inexperienced in computing, for which it will have an administrator mode,
in which you can change the photo, description, title, name, and price of the vehicle, the idea is to create an application that does not need much maintenance
by a software/systems engineer.
